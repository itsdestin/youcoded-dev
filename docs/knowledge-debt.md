# Knowledge Debt

Running list of documentation/rule drift that's been noticed but not yet fixed. Each entry has concrete fix instructions so they persist across sessions.

**How to use this file:**
- Claude appends entries when it notices drift mid-session (outdated claim, renamed file, etc.)
- `/audit` appends entries for any drift detected but not fixed in-session
- User reviews periodically, applies fixes, removes entries
- Each entry stays until resolved — empty file = no known debt

## Entry format

## Onboarding.tsx screen deferred (noticed 2026-04-12)
- **Claim**: Decomposition v3 §7.12 / §9.10 specify a React Onboarding screen that collects name/comfort/output-style, installs curated packages on first launch, and replaces the conversational setup-wizard as the primary first-run path.
- **Actual**: All backend helpers exist and are bridged to desktop, remote, and Android (skills:install-many, skills:apply-output-style, skills:get-curated-defaults, skills:get-integration-info). The React screen itself has not been built — App.tsx still shows only `FirstRunView` (CLI prereqs) and no toolkit-preferences step. Net effect: after decomposition lands, first-launch users reach an empty app with no curated packages installed and no output style set.
- **Fix**: Build `desktop/src/renderer/components/Onboarding.tsx` — form with name input, comfort radio (beginner/intermediate/power), output-style picker (casual/conversational/academic/professional), and a "install curated defaults" confirm step that calls `window.claude.skills.installMany(curatedIds)` and `window.claude.skills.applyOutputStyle(styleId)`. Gate it in App.tsx after `FirstRunView` completes, keyed on absence of `~/.claude/toolkit-state/config.json` (add a tiny IPC `toolkit:hasConfig` if needed). Must have a skip button so a bug can't brick first launch. Needs live dev-server iteration — don't ship blind.
- **Priority**: high (blocks decomposition merge to master)

## SkillDetail loses star rating + install count after Task 6 (noticed 2026-04-12)
- **Claim**: `SkillDetail.tsx` displays install count and star rating sourced from the marketplace backend.
- **Actual**: Task 6 removed static-stats reads from `skill-provider.ts` (main process). `getSkillDetail()` now returns `installs`, `rating`, and `ratingCount` as `undefined`. `SkillDetail.tsx`'s `<StarRating>` renders `null` when rating is nullish, so the detail panel silently shows no rating or install count. Task 9 only re-wires `SkillCard`, not `SkillDetail`.
- **Why it happened**: Live stats context lives in the renderer (`useMarketplaceStats()`); `skill-provider.ts` runs in Electron main and cannot reach it. `SkillDetail.tsx` was not updated to pull from the renderer-side stats context the way `SkillCard` will be in Task 9.
- **Fix**: In the Task 9 follow-up (or a dedicated follow-up), update `SkillDetail.tsx` to call `useMarketplaceStats()` and merge the live `installs`/`rating`/`ratingCount` numbers from context — same pattern as SkillCard. Until then: detail panel ratings are absent; SkillCard ratings also remain broken until Task 9 ships.
- **Priority**: high (visible regression — users see no rating or install count in the skill detail panel)

## Icon override system is dead code (noticed 2026-04-12)
- **Claim**: `theme.icons` manifest entries (slots: send, new-chat, settings, theme-cycle, close, menu per `youcoded/desktop/src/renderer/themes/theme-types.ts:75`) override the app's built-in icons. `theme-builder` SKILL.md documents generating and shipping `icon-<slot>.svg` assets. Exemplar theme `golden-sunbreak/manifest.json` ships a `send` override.
- **Actual**: Manifest loading and asset resolution work end-to-end (`theme-asset-resolver.ts:52-58`), but **zero React components consume `theme.icons[slot]`**. Every UI icon — send button (`InputBar.tsx:493-495`), settings gear + view toggle + gamepad (`HeaderBar.tsx`), new session (`SessionStrip.tsx`) — is hardcoded inline SVG that ignores the override map. `golden-sunbreak`'s `send` override has been dead data since shipped.
- **Fix**: Either (a) wire each icon-rendering component to check `theme.icons[slot]` before falling back to its hardcoded SVG, and expand slots to cover terminal/chat-view/game/session-add, OR (b) remove the `icons` field from `theme-types.ts` + manifest schema + SKILL.md and stop pretending it works. Also update `theme-builder/scripts/mockup-render.js` if (a) — mockup's chrome SVGs are also hardcoded. Tracked in youcoded issue.
- **Priority**: medium (affects every theme's claimed override capability; blocks theme-builder icon pack work)

## Sign + size-cap announcement payload (noticed 2026-04-21, surfaced by /release v1.2.0 review)
- **Claim**: AnnouncementService (desktop `desktop/src/main/announcement-service.ts`, Android `app/src/main/kotlin/com/youcoded/app/runtime/AnnouncementService.kt`) fetches the public `announcements.txt` from `raw.githubusercontent.com/itsdestin/youcoded/master/announcements.txt` over HTTPS and writes the result to the local cache.
- **Actual**: Fetch is unauthenticated and unsigned. Any future compromise of the youcoded repo (or the single file) lets an attacker push arbitrary banner text into the status bar of every installed client. Length is also unbounded — a multi-megabyte payload would bloat the cache and the StatusBar render path.
- **Fix**: (1) Sign `announcements.txt` with a static public key committed to the app, verify the signature in both fetchers before writing to cache, fail-closed on signature mismatch. (2) Cap the parsed announcement length server-side in the parser (e.g. 512 chars) before persisting. (3) Document the trust model in the announcements README so contributors know not to bypass the signing step.
- **Priority**: low (no current incident; defense-in-depth hardening)

## CC-drift: Verify tool-card display after Glob/Grep merge into Bash tool on native builds (surfaced 2026-04-21, from CC v2.1.117)
CC v2.1.117 merged the Glob and Grep tools into the Bash tool on native macOS/Linux builds (Windows desktop and Android npm builds are unchanged). YouCoded's transcript-watcher dispatches TRANSCRIPT_TOOL_USE with tool names; ToolCards render per-tool UI. If Glob/Grep calls now surface as `tool_name='Bash'` in transcript JSONL on native builds, any tool-name-specific rendering (icons, labels) drops through to the Bash fallback. Affects desktop macOS/Linux only (CC 2.1.113+ native builds). Touchpoint: 'Transcript JSONL shape'. Verify by running a Grep via native CC and checking the tool card.

CHANGELOG entry: "v2.1.117: Native builds on macOS and Linux: the `Glob` and `Grep` tools are replaced by embedded `bfs` and `ugrep` available through the Bash tool — faster searches without a separate tool round-trip (Windows and npm-installed builds unchanged)"

## CC-drift: Consider surfacing CLAUDE_CODE_FORK_SUBAGENT toggle in settings (surfaced 2026-04-21, from CC v2.1.117)
CC v2.1.117 added `CLAUDE_CODE_FORK_SUBAGENT=1` to enable forked subagents on external builds. YouCoded doesn't expose this today. Could become a developer-mode toggle in the settings panel; low priority, small effort. No coupling today.

CHANGELOG entry: "v2.1.117: Forked subagents can now be enabled on external builds by setting `CLAUDE_CODE_FORK_SUBAGENT=1`"

## CC-drift: Audit sync service against CC's expanded cleanupPeriodDays coverage (surfaced 2026-04-21, from CC v2.1.117)
CC v2.1.117 expanded the `cleanupPeriodDays` retention sweep to also cover `~/.claude/tasks/`, `~/.claude/shell-snapshots/`, and `~/.claude/backups/`. YouCoded's sync-service.ts writes/reads files under `~/.claude/` — if any YouCoded artifacts live under those three newly-swept paths, they could be deleted by CC's retention sweep. Quick audit of sync-service.ts paths worthwhile. No formal touchpoint for these paths today.

CHANGELOG entry: "v2.1.117: The `cleanupPeriodDays` retention sweep now also covers `~/.claude/tasks/`, `~/.claude/shell-snapshots/`, and `~/.claude/backups/`"

## Document Go-binary exec trap in Android runtime docs (noticed 2026-04-23)
- **Claim**: `docs/android-runtime.md` and `docs/PITFALLS.md` document the SELinux W^X bypass via three exec layers — LD_PRELOAD (C/Rust), claude-wrapper.js (Node), and `linker64-env.sh` bash wrappers for Go binaries (gh, fzf, micro). The implication is that running Go binaries through the wrappers is sufficient.
- **Actual**: The wrappers cover bash-invoked Go binaries, but they do not protect against a Go binary's own calls to `fork/exec` on scripts in the app's home dir. Go's raw `SYS_execve` syscall bypasses termux-exec's LD_PRELOAD intercept, so scripts under `~/.claude-mobile/*` (e.g. `xdg-open`, `open`, any shim placed on PATH) fail with `EACCES` when execed by any Go child. Hit in the wild by rclone's Google Drive OAuth auto-browser-open on Android — fix shipped in youcoded 6469e058 (`authGdriveWithBrowserIntent` streams stderr and opens the URL via `PlatformBridge.openUrl` / `Intent.ACTION_VIEW`). Same trap will fire for any future Go binary that tries to shell out to a `~/.claude-mobile/` shim (e.g. a Go tool that opens URLs via `xdg-open`, or spawns a helper script there).
- **Fix**: Add a subsection to `docs/android-runtime.md` under "System Fundamentals" (or `docs/PITFALLS.md` under "Android Runtime") titled something like "Go binaries can't exec scripts in `~/.claude-mobile/`." Explain: (1) why (LD_PRELOAD shim only intercepts libc execve, Go uses raw syscall), (2) the symptom (`EACCES` at fork/exec), (3) the two safe paths (spawn the Go process from bash with the linker64 wrappers so only the Go binary itself runs, then route any URL-open / native UI through `PlatformBridge` or a `CompletableDeferred` native-UI bridge), (4) cross-link to the rclone fix in SyncService.kt as the reference implementation. Also mention in the "# Known Pitfalls" list of CLAUDE.md that this is now a documented class of bug.
- **Priority**: medium (next Go-binary integration will re-hit this silently; the fix pattern is non-obvious without docs)

> **D1–D8 resolved on 2026-04-23.** Full details and applied fixes in `docs/AUDIT.md`. One follow-up: the D4 edit to `youcoded/.claude/rules/android-runtime.md` still needs to be committed + pushed in the youcoded repo.
