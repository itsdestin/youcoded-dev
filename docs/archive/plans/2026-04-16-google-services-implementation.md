# Google Services Bundle — Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Ship the `google-services` marketplace plugin — one installable bundle that connects a user's Gmail, Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides, and Calendar via `googleworkspace/cli` (`gws`) with a single setup command that automates GCP project provisioning via `gcloud`.

**Architecture:** Six sibling skills (`skills/gmail/`, `skills/google-drive/`, etc.) under one plugin, plus a `/google-services-setup` slash command that installs helper tools, bootstraps the user's personal GCP project, grants OAuth scopes, and runs read-only probes. No custom MCP; skills call `gws` directly. All auth state owned by `gws` keyring, never by the plugin.

**Tech Stack:** Bash scripts, Markdown skills with YAML frontmatter, JSON manifests, `gws` (Rust CLI), `gcloud` (Google Cloud SDK), `shellcheck` for script linting.

**Spec:** [docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-16-google-services-design.md](../specs/2026-04-16-google-services-design.md). Keep the spec open while implementing — every task references a spec section.

**Cross-repo scope.** Implementation touches three repos:
- `wecoded-marketplace/` — the new plugin (majority of work)
- `youcoded-core/` — one hook edit (tool-router.sh)
- `wecoded-marketplace/youcoded-messaging/` — delete the `imessages/` subdirectory

**Worktree rule (from workspace CLAUDE.md).** Create isolated worktrees for each repo being modified. Work within them, merge + push at phase boundaries.

---

## Phase 0 — Research (RESOLVED 2026-04-16)

All three research items were resolved via documentation review in a prior session. Findings + spec updates are committed (`629ac15`). Summary:

- **Item 1 (7-day refresh-token expiry) — 🔴 RED.** Policy still enforced. Mitigated by wrapper-driven auto-reauth; no `--reauth` command for users. [findings](research/2026-04-16-refresh-token-findings.md)
- **Item 2 (`gcloud` External-consent automation) — 🟡 YELLOW.** IAP OAuth Admin API shut down 2026-03-19; ~3–5 min of guided Cloud Console clicks per user unavoidable. [findings](research/2026-04-16-oauth-brand-automation.md)
- **Item 3 (`gws` Slides write coverage) — 🟢 GREEN.** Full read + write via `batchUpdate`; export/list hop to Drive. [findings](research/2026-04-16-gws-slides-coverage.md)

Spec section ["Research outcomes"](../specs/2026-04-16-google-services-design.md#research-outcomes-resolved-2026-04-16) has the authoritative writeup. **This phase is done; no further tasks here. Proceed to Phase 1.**

---

## Phase 1 — Worktrees and scaffolding

### Task 1.1: Set up worktrees for all affected repos

**Files:**
- Create: `wecoded-marketplace/` worktree at `C:/Users/desti/youcoded-dev/.worktrees/google-services-marketplace`
- Create: `youcoded-core/` worktree at `C:/Users/desti/youcoded-dev/.worktrees/google-services-core`

- [ ] **Step 1: Sync both repos with origin**

```bash
cd C:/Users/desti/youcoded-dev/wecoded-marketplace && git fetch origin && git pull origin master
cd C:/Users/desti/youcoded-dev/youcoded-core && git fetch origin && git pull origin master
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Create the marketplace worktree**

```bash
cd C:/Users/desti/youcoded-dev/wecoded-marketplace
git worktree add ../.worktrees/google-services-marketplace -b feat/google-services
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Create the core worktree**

```bash
cd C:/Users/desti/youcoded-dev/youcoded-core
git worktree add ../.worktrees/google-services-core -b feat/google-services-hook-cleanup
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Verify worktrees exist**

```bash
cd C:/Users/desti/youcoded-dev/wecoded-marketplace && git worktree list
cd C:/Users/desti/youcoded-dev/youcoded-core && git worktree list
```

Expected: both output include the new `.worktrees/google-services-*` paths.

### Task 1.2: Create the plugin directory skeleton

**Spec reference:** Architecture — Plugin layout.

**Files:**
- Create: `wecoded-marketplace/google-services/plugin.json`
- Create: `wecoded-marketplace/google-services/commands/` (empty dir)
- Create: `wecoded-marketplace/google-services/skills/` (empty dir)
- Create: `wecoded-marketplace/google-services/setup/` (empty dir)
- Create: `wecoded-marketplace/google-services/lib/` (empty dir)
- Create: `wecoded-marketplace/google-services/docs/` (empty dir)
- Create: `wecoded-marketplace/google-services/.gitkeep` files for empty dirs

- [ ] **Step 1: Create directories**

```bash
cd C:/Users/desti/youcoded-dev/.worktrees/google-services-marketplace
mkdir -p google-services/commands google-services/skills google-services/setup google-services/lib google-services/docs
# Placeholders so git tracks the dirs
touch google-services/commands/.gitkeep google-services/skills/.gitkeep google-services/setup/.gitkeep google-services/lib/.gitkeep google-services/docs/.gitkeep
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Write plugin.json**

Write `wecoded-marketplace/google-services/plugin.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "google-services",
  "displayName": "Google Services",
  "description": "Connect Gmail, Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides, and Calendar with one setup. Works on personal Google accounts.",
  "longDescription": "Google Services gives YouCoded access to your Gmail, Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides, and Calendar in a single install. Run /google-services-setup once and YouCoded will walk you through connecting your account — no technical setup required. Your account stays yours: every credential is stored in your OS keyring, and the connection is made through a private Google Cloud project that only you can access.\n\nAfter setup, ask Claude things like \"send an email to Mom,\" \"find my budget spreadsheet from last week,\" or \"what's on my calendar tomorrow\" — Claude picks the right Google app automatically.",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "author": "YouCoded",
  "category": "integrations",
  "tags": ["google", "gmail", "drive", "docs", "sheets", "slides", "calendar", "workspace"],
  "publishedAt": "2026-04-16",
  "sourceMarketplace": "youcoded"
}
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Validate the JSON parses**

```bash
cd C:/Users/desti/youcoded-dev/.worktrees/google-services-marketplace
python -c "import json; json.load(open('google-services/plugin.json'))" && echo OK
```

Expected: `OK`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add google-services/
git commit -m "feat(google-services): scaffold plugin directory + plugin.json

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

### Task 1.3: Register google-services in wecoded-marketplace/index.json

**Spec reference:** Migration section.

**Files:**
- Modify: `wecoded-marketplace/index.json` — add google-services entry, leave deprecated google-workspace entry in place for now (deleted in Phase 6)

- [ ] **Step 1: Read the current index.json to understand entry shape**

```bash
cd C:/Users/desti/youcoded-dev/.worktrees/google-services-marketplace
python -c "import json; entries = json.load(open('index.json')); print(json.dumps(entries[0], indent=2))"
```

Record the exact schema — `id`, `displayName`, `description`, `version`, `sourceMarketplace`, `sourceRef`, tags, etc.

- [ ] **Step 2: Add the google-services entry**

Open `index.json` and add an entry matching the shape observed in Step 1, with:
- `id`: "google-services"
- `sourceRef`: "./google-services"
- `sourceMarketplace`: "youcoded"
- version: "0.1.0"
- fields copied from `google-services/plugin.json`

- [ ] **Step 3: Validate JSON parses**

```bash
python -c "import json; json.load(open('index.json'))" && echo OK
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add index.json
git commit -m "feat(marketplace): register google-services plugin in index

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

---

## Phase 2 — Setup infrastructure (shell scripts)

All scripts live in `wecoded-marketplace/google-services/setup/`. Each is tested with `shellcheck` as a baseline lint, plus a manual smoke invocation where practical. All use `set -euo pipefail` for fail-fast semantics and all user-facing text follows the non-technical-language policy from the spec.

### Task 2.1: Write install-gcloud.sh

**Spec reference:** Architecture — Plugin layout; User-facing flow Step 1.

**Files:**
- Create: `wecoded-marketplace/google-services/setup/install-gcloud.sh`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the script**

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# install-gcloud.sh
# Detects whether gcloud is installed; if not, prompts the user and installs
# it via the platform's package manager.
# User-facing text follows the non-technical-language policy — no "CLI," "SDK,"
# or other jargon in user-visible strings.

set -euo pipefail

if command -v gcloud >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  echo "Google helper tool already installed."
  exit 0
fi

echo ""
echo "YouCoded needs to install a small helper tool from Google"
echo "to connect to your account safely. This takes about 2 minutes"
echo "and about 500 MB of disk space."

      sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y google-cloud-cli
    else
      echo "Your Linux distribution isn't supported by this installer."
      echo "Install the Google helper tool manually from https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install"
      echo "then re-run /google-services-setup."

      echo "winget (Windows Package Manager) is required. Install from the Microsoft Store,"
      echo "then re-run /google-services-setup."
      exit 1
    fi
    winget install --id Google.CloudSDK --accept-package-agreements --accept-source-agreements
    ;;
  *)
    echo "Unsupported operating system: $OS"
    exit 1
    ;;
esac

# Verify the install
if ! command -v gcloud >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  # On some platforms gcloud is installed but not yet on PATH in this shell
  echo ""
  echo "Installation complete, but you may need to restart your terminal"
  echo "to use the tool. After restarting, run /google-services-setup again."
  exit 2
fi

echo "Google helper tool installed."
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Make it executable and add the Windows git bit**

```bash
cd C:/Users/desti/youcoded-dev/.worktrees/google-services-marketplace
chmod +x google-services/setup/install-gcloud.sh
git update-index --chmod=+x google-services/setup/install-gcloud.sh
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Lint with shellcheck**

```bash
shellcheck google-services/setup/install-gcloud.sh
```

Expected: no warnings. Fix any that appear.

- [ ] **Step 4: Dry-run on this machine (gcloud should already be present from research phase)**

```bash
bash google-services/setup/install-gcloud.sh
```

Expected: prints "Google helper tool already installed." and exits 0.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add google-services/setup/install-gcloud.sh
git commit -m "feat(google-services): add install-gcloud.sh setup helper

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

### Task 2.2: Write install-gws.sh

**Spec reference:** Architecture — Plugin layout; Foundation.

**Files:**
- Create: `wecoded-marketplace/google-services/setup/install-gws.sh`

- [ ] **Step 1: Determine pinned gws version**

Check https://github.com/googleworkspace/cli/releases and pick the latest stable (not pre-release). Record version string (e.g., `v0.22.5`) for use in the script.

- [ ] **Step 2: Write the script**

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# install-gws.sh
# Detects whether the pinned version of gws is installed; if not, installs it
# via brew/cargo/prebuilt binary depending on the platform.

set -euo pipefail

git update-index --chmod=+x google-services/setup/install-gws.sh
shellcheck google-services/setup/install-gws.sh
bash google-services/setup/install-gws.sh
```

Expected: shellcheck passes; script either reports "already installed" or performs a fresh install.

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add google-services/setup/install-gws.sh
git commit -m "feat(google-services): add install-gws.sh setup helper (pinned $GWS_PINNED_VERSION)

```

### Task 2.3: Write bootstrap-gcp.sh (scripted scaffold only)

**Spec reference:** User-facing flow Step 3A.

Per Research Item 2, OAuth consent brand + client-ID creation for External apps can NOT be automated via `gcloud` in 2026. Those steps move to `consent-walkthrough.sh` (Task 2.3.5). This script now owns only the scripted portion: project create + API enable.

**Files:**
- Create: `wecoded-marketplace/google-services/setup/bootstrap-gcp.sh`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the script**

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# bootstrap-gcp.sh
# Drives gcloud to create the user's personal YouCoded GCP project and enable
# the six Google APIs. Idempotent: on re-run, detects existing project and
# resumes (covers "project exists but N of 6 APIs enabled").
#
# Writes the created/found project_id to $YOUCODED_OUTPUT_DIR/project.env for
# later scripts to consume. Does NOT handle OAuth consent/client creation —
# that moved to consent-walkthrough.sh (per IAP OAuth Admin API shutdown).
#
# Emits plain-language progress as lines prefixed with "  ✓" for the slash
# command to echo directly.

set -euo pipefail

APIS=(gmail.googleapis.com drive.googleapis.com docs.googleapis.com
      sheets.googleapis.com slides.googleapis.com calendar-json.googleapis.com)

: "${YOUCODED_OUTPUT_DIR:?must be set}"

# ------- Idempotency: detect existing YouCoded project -------
EXISTING_PROJECT=$(gcloud projects list --filter="name:YouCoded Personal" --format="value(projectId)" 2>/dev/null | head -n1)

if [ -n "$EXISTING_PROJECT" ]; then
  PROJECT_ID="$EXISTING_PROJECT"
  echo "  ✓ Found existing YouCoded connection ($PROJECT_ID)"
else
  SUFFIX=$(LC_ALL=C tr -dc 'a-z0-9' </dev/urandom | head -c 6)
  PROJECT_ID="youcoded-personal-$SUFFIX"
  gcloud projects create "$PROJECT_ID" --name="YouCoded Personal" --quiet >/dev/null
  echo "  ✓ Created your private YouCoded connection"
fi

gcloud config set project "$PROJECT_ID" --quiet >/dev/null

# ------- Enable the six APIs (idempotent per-API) -------
for api in "${APIS[@]}"; do
  case "$api" in
    gmail.googleapis.com)          label="Gmail" ;;
    drive.googleapis.com)          label="Drive" ;;
    docs.googleapis.com)           label="Docs" ;;
    sheets.googleapis.com)         label="Sheets" ;;
    slides.googleapis.com)         label="Slides" ;;
    calendar-json.googleapis.com)  label="Calendar" ;;
  esac
  if gcloud services list --enabled --filter="name:$api" --format="value(name)" | grep -q "$api"; then
    echo "  ✓ $label already unlocked"
  else
    gcloud services enable "$api" --quiet >/dev/null
    echo "  ✓ Unlocked $label"
  fi
done

# ------- Emit project_id for downstream scripts -------
mkdir -p "$YOUCODED_OUTPUT_DIR"
printf 'PROJECT_ID=%s\n' "$PROJECT_ID" > "$YOUCODED_OUTPUT_DIR/project.env"
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Make executable, lint**

```bash
cd C:/Users/desti/youcoded-dev/.worktrees/google-services-marketplace
chmod +x google-services/setup/bootstrap-gcp.sh
git update-index --chmod=+x google-services/setup/bootstrap-gcp.sh
shellcheck google-services/setup/bootstrap-gcp.sh
```

Expected: shellcheck passes.

- [ ] **Step 3: Run end-to-end against a throwaway project**

```bash
export YOUCODED_OUTPUT_DIR=/tmp/google-services-test-$$
bash google-services/setup/bootstrap-gcp.sh
cat "$YOUCODED_OUTPUT_DIR/project.env"
```

Expected: `project.env` file exists with PROJECT_ID line. Each `✓` line appears. Re-run — detects existing project, APIs, skips recreation (test idempotency).

Tear down after: `gcloud projects delete <project-id>`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add google-services/setup/bootstrap-gcp.sh
git commit -m "feat(google-services): add bootstrap-gcp.sh (project + API enable)

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

### Task 2.3.5: Write consent-walkthrough.sh (guided console steps)

**Spec reference:** User-facing flow Step 3B + 3C.

Owns the manual portion of setup that cannot be automated (per Research Item 2 YELLOW). Opens Cloud Console deep-links, prints click-by-click instructions, captures pasted OAuth client ID + secret, writes `oauth-credentials.json`.

**Files:**
- Create: `wecoded-marketplace/google-services/setup/consent-walkthrough.sh`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the script**

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# consent-walkthrough.sh
# Guides the user through the ~3 minutes of Cloud Console clicks that Google
# does not permit to be automated for External OAuth apps. Idempotent: if
# oauth-credentials.json already exists, skips and reports "already configured."

set -euo pipefail

: "${YOUCODED_OUTPUT_DIR:?must be set}"

source "$YOUCODED_OUTPUT_DIR/project.env"  # provides PROJECT_ID
: "${PROJECT_ID:?project.env missing PROJECT_ID}"

CREDS_FILE="$YOUCODED_OUTPUT_DIR/oauth-credentials.json"

if [ -f "$CREDS_FILE" ]; then
  echo "  ✓ Permissions screen already configured"
  exit 0
fi

# ------- Open cross-platform -------
open_url() {
  local url="$1"
  case "$(uname -s)" in
    Darwin)                     open "$url" ;;
    Linux)                      xdg-open "$url" 2>/dev/null || echo "Open this URL in your browser: $url" ;;
    MINGW*|MSYS*|CYGWIN*)       start "" "$url" ;;
    *)                          echo "Open this URL in your browser: $url" ;;
  esac
}

# ------- Step 3B: Consent screen configuration -------
cat <<EOF

One quick thing I can't do for you automatically.

Google needs you to set up the permissions screen yourself. I've
opened the page in your browser — follow along:

  1. Click "Get Started"
  2. Choose audience: "External"   (important — not "Internal")
  3. App name: "YouCoded Personal"
  4. Support email: your own email
  5. Click Save and Continue through the next screens
  6. On the "Test users" screen, add your own email as a test user
  7. Click Back to Dashboard

EOF

open_url "https://console.cloud.google.com/auth/branding?project=$PROJECT_ID"

read -r -p "Press Enter when you're done..." _

# ------- Step 3C: OAuth client ID creation -------
cat <<EOF

One more page. Opening your browser now.

  1. Click "Create Credentials" → "OAuth client ID"
  2. Application type: "Desktop app"
  3. Name: "YouCoded Personal"
  4. Click Create
  5. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret from the box that appears
  6. Paste them below when prompted

EOF

open_url "https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials?project=$PROJECT_ID"

read -r -p "Client ID: " CLIENT_ID
read -r -s -p "Client Secret: " CLIENT_SECRET
echo

if [ -z "$CLIENT_ID" ] || [ -z "$CLIENT_SECRET" ]; then
  echo ""
  echo "Couldn't read the credentials. Re-run /google-services-setup to try again."
  exit 1
fi

# ------- Write credentials -------
umask 077  # file readable only by current user
cat > "$CREDS_FILE" <<EOF
{
  "client_id": "$CLIENT_ID",
  "client_secret": "$CLIENT_SECRET",
  "project_id": "$PROJECT_ID"
}
EOF

echo "  ✓ Saved your permissions setup"
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Make executable, lint**

```bash
cd C:/Users/desti/youcoded-dev/.worktrees/google-services-marketplace
chmod +x google-services/setup/consent-walkthrough.sh
git update-index --chmod=+x google-services/setup/consent-walkthrough.sh
shellcheck google-services/setup/consent-walkthrough.sh
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Manual walkthrough against a throwaway project**

```bash
# Assumes bootstrap-gcp.sh has already run for this $YOUCODED_OUTPUT_DIR
bash google-services/setup/consent-walkthrough.sh
cat "$YOUCODED_OUTPUT_DIR/oauth-credentials.json"
```

Expected: browser opens twice; after pasting, `oauth-credentials.json` contains valid client_id + secret; file mode is 0600.

Idempotency test: re-run, should report "already configured" and exit without re-prompting.

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add google-services/setup/consent-walkthrough.sh
git commit -m "feat(google-services): add consent-walkthrough.sh (guided console setup)

### Task 2.4: Write smoke-test.sh

**Spec reference:** User-facing flow Step 6; per-integration "Shipped probe" lines.

**Files:**
- Create: `wecoded-marketplace/google-services/setup/smoke-test.sh`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the script**

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# smoke-test.sh
# Runs a read-only probe against each of the six Google services after setup
# completes. Each probe is a minimal gws call that verifies the OAuth scope
# for that service was granted. No writes. Output is parsed by the slash
# command to show ✓ / ✗ per service.

set -u  # not -e: we want to test all six and report outcomes, not abort on first fail

declare -A RESULTS

probe() {
  local label="$1"; shift
  local hint="$1"; shift
  if "$@" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    RESULTS[$label]="PASS"
    echo "  ✓ $label"
  else
    RESULTS[$label]="FAIL:$hint"
    echo "  ✗ $label — $hint"
  fi

exit 0
```

Adjust the `gws <service> list` commands if Task 0.3 research revealed different subcommand names. Some services (Docs, Sheets, Slides) might not have a top-level `list`; the fallback is `gws drive list --mime-type <type>`.

### Task 2.5: Write lib/gws-wrapper.sh (AUTH_EXPIRED contract)

**Spec reference:** Per-integration detail — Shared concerns; Auto-reauth flow.

The wrapper's job is to forward `gws` calls and translate auth errors into a stable exit code (**2**) + a structured stderr marker (**`AUTH_EXPIRED:<service>`**) so every skill can react uniformly. The wrapper does NOT drive reauth itself; that's Claude's job via `reauth.sh` (Task 2.5.5).

**Files:**
- Create: `wecoded-marketplace/google-services/lib/gws-wrapper.sh`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the wrapper**

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# gws-wrapper.sh
# Exposes gws_run — the single function every skill uses to invoke gws.
# Sourced (not exec'd) via: source "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/lib/gws-wrapper.sh"
#
# Exit code contract (consumed by skills):
#   0 — gws command succeeded; stdout contains gws output
#   2 — auth expired; stderr contains exactly one line "AUTH_EXPIRED:<service>"
#   other — any other gws error; stderr forwarded verbatim

gws_auth_status() {
  # 0 if gws has a valid token for the current account, nonzero otherwise.
  gws auth status --json 2>/dev/null | grep -q '"authenticated": true'
}

gws_run() {
  # First positional arg is the service (gmail, drive, docs, sheets, slides,
  # calendar). Rest are passed through to gws.
  local service="$1"

  local out rc
  out=$(gws "$@" 2>&1)
  rc=$?

  if [ "$rc" -eq 0 ]; then
    printf '%s\n' "$out"
    return 0
  fi

  # Auth-error signature detection. Patterns pinned to gws v0.22.5 error surface.
  # Re-verify on every gws version bump (see Research Item 1 notes in spec).
  case "$out" in
    *"invalid_grant"*|*"token has been expired or revoked"*|\
    *"unauthorized_client"*|*"AuthenticationError"*|\
    *"authorization is required"*)
      printf 'AUTH_EXPIRED:%s\n' "$service" >&2
      return 2
      ;;
    *)
      printf '%s\n' "$out" >&2
      return "$rc"
      ;;
  esac
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Make executable, lint**

```bash
cd C:/Users/desti/youcoded-dev/.worktrees/google-services-marketplace
chmod +x google-services/lib/gws-wrapper.sh
git update-index --chmod=+x google-services/lib/gws-wrapper.sh
shellcheck google-services/lib/gws-wrapper.sh
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Happy-path test**

```bash
bash -c 'source google-services/lib/gws-wrapper.sh && gws_run gmail list --max 1 && echo "exit=$?"'
```

Expected: gws output printed; `exit=0`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Auth-expired test**

Temporarily break the auth state and verify the wrapper's signal. One way: revoke the access token in Google Account settings, then:

```bash
bash -c 'source google-services/lib/gws-wrapper.sh; gws_run gmail list --max 1; echo "exit=$?"'
```

Expected: stderr contains exactly `AUTH_EXPIRED:gmail`; exit code 2.

Restore auth before continuing (run reauth.sh from Task 2.5.5 once that task is done, or /google-services-setup).

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add google-services/lib/gws-wrapper.sh
git commit -m "feat(google-services): add gws-wrapper.sh with AUTH_EXPIRED contract

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

### Task 2.5.5: Write reauth.sh (auto-reauth helper)

**Spec reference:** Auto-reauth flow.

Invoked by Claude when any skill returns exit 2. Re-runs the OAuth grant using the already-stored client credentials; does NOT touch the GCP project.

**Files:**
- Create: `wecoded-marketplace/google-services/setup/reauth.sh`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the script**

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# reauth.sh
# Invoked by Claude (not by the user) when a skill signals AUTH_EXPIRED.
# Reuses the OAuth client credentials written during initial setup.
# Exit 0 on success, 1 on failure (user closed browser, network error, etc).

set -u

CREDS_FILE="$HOME/.youcoded/google-services/oauth-credentials.json"

if [ ! -f "$CREDS_FILE" ]; then
  echo "No saved Google setup found. Run /google-services-setup first." >&2
  exit 1
fi

CLIENT_ID=$(python - <<PY "$CREDS_FILE"
import json, sys
print(json.load(open(sys.argv[1]))["client_id"])
PY
)
CLIENT_SECRET=$(python - <<PY "$CREDS_FILE"
import json, sys
print(json.load(open(sys.argv[1]))["client_secret"])
PY
)

# gws auth setup re-runs the browser OAuth flow using the provided credentials.
# The exact flag surface is version-sensitive; adjust if the pinned gws version
# uses a different entry point (see spec's "Implementer notes" under Auto-reauth).
gws auth setup \
  --client-id "$CLIENT_ID" \
  --client-secret "$CLIENT_SECRET" \
  --non-interactive-confirm \
  || exit 1

exit 0
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Make executable, lint**

```bash
cd C:/Users/desti/youcoded-dev/.worktrees/google-services-marketplace
chmod +x google-services/setup/reauth.sh
git update-index --chmod=+x google-services/setup/reauth.sh
shellcheck google-services/setup/reauth.sh
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Run against a real expired auth**

Provoke `AUTH_EXPIRED` (revoke token, or wait for natural 7-day expiry during testing). Run:

```bash
bash google-services/setup/reauth.sh
echo "exit=$?"
```

Expected: browser opens to Google consent page (NOT the unverified-app warning — that only appears on first grant); user clicks Allow; exit=0; subsequent `gws gmail list --max 1` succeeds.

- [ ] **Step 4: Verify gws auth setup flag surface**

The `--client-id` / `--client-secret` / `--non-interactive-confirm` flags are assumed based on the spec's design. At implementation time, run `gws auth setup --help` against the pinned version and confirm these flag names. If they differ, adjust the script and document in the commit message. If `gws auth setup` can't accept pre-supplied credentials non-interactively at all, see the spec's "Implementer notes" for fallback paths.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add google-services/setup/reauth.sh
git commit -m "feat(google-services): add reauth.sh auto-reauth helper

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

### Task 2.6: Write the /google-services-setup slash command

**Spec reference:** User-facing flow (entire section).

**Files:**
- Create: `wecoded-marketplace/google-services/commands/google-services-setup.md`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the command markdown**

Markdown slash commands run as a prompt template Claude follows. The contents tell Claude what to do; Claude executes bash steps via its tool access.

```markdown
---
description: "Set up Google Services (Gmail, Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides, Calendar) with one command. Installs helper tools, connects your Google account, and verifies each service works."
---

Run the Google Services bundle setup. Follow these steps in order. Show the user each line exactly as specified — all user-visible text below is final copy, do NOT paraphrase.

## Step 0 — System check

Echo:

```
Getting Google apps ready for YouCoded...
```

Detect the OS with `uname -s`. If the OS is not one of Darwin / Linux / MINGW*/MSYS*/CYGWIN*, abort with:

```
Sorry — Google Services setup doesn't support your system yet.
```

## Step 1 — Helper tools

Run `bash $PLUGIN_DIR/setup/install-gcloud.sh` and `bash $PLUGIN_DIR/setup/install-gws.sh` in that order. Each may prompt the user for install consent; honor their response. If either exits with code 2 (install complete but PATH not updated), stop and tell the user to restart their terminal and re-run `/google-services-setup`.

## Step 2 — First sign-in

Echo the framing text:

```
Next, YouCoded will open your browser twice to connect to Google:

  1. First, to create a private connection in your Google account
  2. Then, to ask your permission to use Gmail, Drive, Calendar,
     and your Google documents

The private connection is yours — it belongs to your Google
account, not to YouCoded or anyone else.

Press Enter to open your browser...
```

Wait for Enter, then run `gcloud auth login`. If it exits nonzero, abort with:

```
Sign-in didn't complete. Run /google-services-setup again when you're ready.
```

## Step 3 — Setting it up (4-phase hybrid)

Per the spec, this splits into (A) scripted scaffolding, (B) guided consent screen, (C) paste OAuth client credentials, (D) automated OAuth. Set the output dir once and run the scripts in order.

### Step 3A — Scripted scaffold

Echo "Setting up..." then run:

```bash
export YOUCODED_OUTPUT_DIR="$HOME/.youcoded/google-services"
bash $PLUGIN_DIR/setup/bootstrap-gcp.sh
```

`bootstrap-gcp.sh` emits each `  ✓` line itself — do not add extras. If it exits nonzero, abort with the error it printed.

### Step 3B + 3C — Guided console walkthrough

Run:

```bash
bash $PLUGIN_DIR/setup/consent-walkthrough.sh
```

The script:
- Prints the Step 3B block ("One quick thing I can't do for you automatically...") and opens Cloud Console's OAuth Consent Screen page. Waits for user to press Enter.
- Prints the Step 3C block ("One more page...") and opens Cloud Console's Credentials page. Prompts for client ID and client secret paste-in.
- Writes `$YOUCODED_OUTPUT_DIR/oauth-credentials.json`.

If it exits nonzero, abort with the error it printed.

## Step 4 — Unverified-app warning

Read the generated client_id to show the exact project ID:

```bash
PROJECT_ID=$(python -c "import json; print(json.load(open('$YOUCODED_OUTPUT_DIR/oauth-credentials.json'))['project_id'])")
```

Then echo (substituting `$PROJECT_ID`):

```
⚠ Heads up: on the next screen, Google will show you a warning
that says "Google hasn't verified this app."

This is expected and safe. The "app" is you — YouCoded just set
up a private connection inside your own Google account, and now
you're giving yourself permission to use it.

To continue through Google's warning:
  • Click "Advanced"
  • Click "Go to $PROJECT_ID (unsafe)"

Press Enter to continue...
```

Wait for Enter.

## Step 5 — Grant permissions

Echo:

```
Opening Google's permission page...

Google will ask whether YouCoded can read your email, access
your Drive files, and so on. Please check every box — leaving
any unchecked will cause some features to not work.
```

Run `gws auth setup --client-id <id> --client-secret <secret>` sourcing the credentials from `$YOUCODED_OUTPUT_DIR/oauth-credentials.json` (parse via `python -c "import json; ..."`). If `gws auth setup` exits nonzero, abort with:

```
Looks like you didn't finish approving the permissions. When
you're ready, run /google-services-setup again — this time click
"Advanced" then "Continue" on Google's warning screen.
```

## Step 6 — Make sure it actually works

Echo "Testing your connection..." then run `bash $PLUGIN_DIR/setup/smoke-test.sh`.

If exit 0: echo the "All set!" block:

```
All set! Try asking YouCoded something like:
  "Send an email to Mom"
  "Find my budget spreadsheet from last week"
  "What's on my calendar tomorrow?"
```

If exit nonzero: the smoke-test script already printed which service failed. Add:

```
Setup not yet complete. Run /google-services-setup again to retry the failing service.
```

Do NOT report success when any probe failed.

## Step 7 — Migration cleanup

Run `bash $PLUGIN_DIR/setup/migrate-legacy.sh` (exists only if legacy artifacts detected; script echoes its own `  ✓` line or nothing). The migrate script is added in Phase 6 of implementation; if not present yet, skip this step silently.

---

Throughout all steps: user-facing language only. Never surface "API," "gws," "gcloud," "OAuth scope," etc. in strings the user reads. Internal log lines for debugging are fine.
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Commit**

```bash
git add google-services/commands/google-services-setup.md
git commit -m "feat(google-services): add /google-services-setup slash command

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

---

## Phase 3 — Skills (six sibling SKILL.md files)

Each skill is a short, focused Markdown file with YAML frontmatter. The `description` field is how Claude's skill matcher decides when to invoke — calibrate so each skill has a tight, non-overlapping trigger. Body is ~100-250 words: what this skill does, what `gws` commands it wraps, how to use them, and links to the wrapper helper.

### Task 3.1: Write skills/gmail/SKILL.md

**Spec reference:** Per-integration detail — Gmail.

**Files:**
- Create: `wecoded-marketplace/google-services/skills/gmail/SKILL.md`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the skill**

```markdown
---
name: gmail
description: "Use when the user wants to send, read, search, label, or draft email in their Gmail inbox. Triggers on: send an email, check my inbox, find emails from, reply to, draft a message, add a label. Does NOT handle Google Chat or Google Messages (those are other bundles)."
---

# Gmail

Connects to the user's Gmail via `gws gmail`. Auth is managed by `/google-services-setup` — this skill assumes `gws auth status` is valid.

## Core commands

Source the shared wrapper before invoking:

```bash
source "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/lib/gws-wrapper.sh"
```

Then use `gws_run gmail <...>` (never call `gws` directly — the wrapper emits the shared reconnect message on auth errors):

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| List recent | `gws_run gmail list --max 10` |
| Read one | `gws_run gmail read <message-id>` |
| Send | `gws_run gmail send --to "<email>" --subject "<s>" --body "<b>"` |
| Draft | `gws_run gmail draft --to "<email>" --subject "<s>" --body "<b>"` |
| Add label | `gws_run gmail label add <message-id> <label-name>` |
| Search | `gws_run gmail list --query "from:alice@example.com"` |

## Format handling

`gws gmail read` returns both HTML and plaintext bodies. Prefer plaintext when summarizing for the user; use HTML when preserving formatting matters (forwarding, etc.).

## Localized labels

If the user's Gmail language is non-English, system labels (Inbox, Sent, Drafts) are returned in their localized names. When filtering by label, prefer the gmail system label ID (e.g., `INBOX`) over the visible name.

## Drafts vs sent

When the user asks to "send," use `gws_run gmail send`. When they ask to "draft" or "prepare," use `gws_run gmail draft`. Never leave both a draft AND a sent copy — pick one.

## Handling auth expiry

Every call uses `gws_run`, which exits **2** with stderr line `AUTH_EXPIRED:<service>` when the user's 7-day OAuth refresh has lapsed.

**When this skill sees exit 2:**
1. Stop the current operation immediately. Do NOT retry automatically.
2. Emit a single marker line Claude can read: `[reauth-required: <service>]`.

**What Claude does next (follow this verbatim):**
1. Tell the user briefly, in natural language: *"Your Google connection needs a quick refresh — I'll open a browser. Approve the permissions and I'll finish {what the user asked for}."*
2. Run `bash "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/setup/reauth.sh"`.
3. On reauth exit 0: retry the original `gws_run` call with the same arguments, then complete the user's request as if nothing happened.
4. On reauth exit 1: tell the user plainly, *"I couldn't refresh the Google connection. Want me to try again, or come back to this later?"*
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Validate YAML frontmatter parses**

```bash
cd C:/Users/desti/youcoded-dev/.worktrees/google-services-marketplace
python -c "import yaml; f=open('google-services/skills/gmail/SKILL.md'); content=f.read(); fm=content.split('---')[1]; print(yaml.safe_load(fm))"
```

Expected: dict with `name` and `description` keys.

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit**

```bash
git add google-services/skills/gmail/SKILL.md
git commit -m "feat(google-services): add gmail skill

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

### Task 3.2: Write skills/google-drive/SKILL.md

**Spec reference:** Per-integration detail — Google Drive.

**Files:**
- Create: `wecoded-marketplace/google-services/skills/google-drive/SKILL.md`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the skill**

```markdown
---
name: google-drive
description: "Use when the user wants to find, download, upload, move, rename, or trash files stored in Google Drive. Triggers on: find my file, upload this to Drive, download from Drive, move a file, where's my X file. Does NOT handle reading/editing document CONTENT — that's google-docs/sheets/slides."
---

# Google Drive

Handles files-as-objects in Drive. Document content belongs to the google-docs / google-sheets / google-slides skills.

```bash
source "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/lib/gws-wrapper.sh"
```

## Core commands

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| List | `gws_run drive list --max 20` |
| Search | `gws_run drive list --query "name contains 'budget'"` |
| Download | `gws_run drive download <file-id> --out <local-path>` |
| Upload | `gws_run drive upload <local-path> --folder <folder-id>` |
| Move | `gws_run drive move <file-id> --to-folder <folder-id>` |
| Rename | `gws_run drive rename <file-id> --to "<new-name>"` |
| Trash | `gws_run drive trash <file-id>` |

## Shared Drives vs My Drive

Default searches and operations target My Drive. If the user mentions a specific shared drive ("in the Finance shared drive"), pass `--drive <drive-id>`. List shared drives with `gws_run drive shared-drives list`.

## MIME conversions

Google-native formats (Docs, Sheets, Slides) download as their native Google format by default. To convert to Office formats, pass `--export-mime application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document` (or the Excel / PowerPoint equivalent).

## Handling auth expiry

Every call uses `gws_run`, which exits **2** with stderr line `AUTH_EXPIRED:<service>` when the user's 7-day OAuth refresh has lapsed.

**When this skill sees exit 2:**
1. Stop the current operation immediately. Do NOT retry automatically.
2. Emit a single marker line Claude can read: `[reauth-required: <service>]`.

**What Claude does next (follow this verbatim):**
1. Tell the user briefly, in natural language: *"Your Google connection needs a quick refresh — I'll open a browser. Approve the permissions and I'll finish {what the user asked for}."*
2. Run `bash "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/setup/reauth.sh"`.
3. On reauth exit 0: retry the original `gws_run` call with the same arguments, then complete the user's request as if nothing happened.
4. On reauth exit 1: tell the user plainly, *"I couldn't refresh the Google connection. Want me to try again, or come back to this later?"*
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Validate + commit**

Same pattern as Task 3.1.

```bash
python -c "import yaml; f=open('google-services/skills/google-drive/SKILL.md'); content=f.read(); fm=content.split('---')[1]; print(yaml.safe_load(fm))"
git add google-services/skills/google-drive/SKILL.md
git commit -m "feat(google-services): add google-drive skill

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

### Task 3.3: Write skills/google-docs/SKILL.md

**Spec reference:** Per-integration detail — Google Docs.

**Files:**
- Create: `wecoded-marketplace/google-services/skills/google-docs/SKILL.md`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the skill**

```markdown
---
name: google-docs
description: "Use when the user wants to read, edit, create, or export the CONTENT of a Google Doc. Triggers on: write a doc about, edit my doc, what does my X doc say, create a doc, export to PDF. Handles document content; does NOT handle finding-the-file operations — those belong to google-drive."
---

# Google Docs

Content-level operations on Google Docs. File-level operations (find, move, trash) belong to google-drive.

```bash
source "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/lib/gws-wrapper.sh"
```

## Core commands

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Read | `gws_run docs get <doc-id>` |
| Create | `gws_run docs create --title "<t>" --body "<b>"` |
| Update | `gws_run docs update <doc-id> --body "<b>"` |
| Export to PDF | `gws_run docs export <doc-id> --format pdf --out <path>` |

## Structured content

`gws docs get` returns JSON with structured blocks (paragraphs, tables, lists, images). When summarizing for the user, flatten to plain text. When preserving structure matters (e.g., they ask "what's in the third table?"), keep the structure.

## Finding a doc

If the user names the doc ("read my budget doc"), call google-drive first to find the ID, then pass the ID here.

## Handling auth expiry

Every call uses `gws_run`, which exits **2** with stderr line `AUTH_EXPIRED:<service>` when the user's 7-day OAuth refresh has lapsed.

**When this skill sees exit 2:**
1. Stop the current operation immediately. Do NOT retry automatically.
2. Emit a single marker line Claude can read: `[reauth-required: <service>]`.

**What Claude does next (follow this verbatim):**
1. Tell the user briefly, in natural language: *"Your Google connection needs a quick refresh — I'll open a browser. Approve the permissions and I'll finish {what the user asked for}."*
2. Run `bash "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/setup/reauth.sh"`.
3. On reauth exit 0: retry the original `gws_run` call with the same arguments, then complete the user's request as if nothing happened.
4. On reauth exit 1: tell the user plainly, *"I couldn't refresh the Google connection. Want me to try again, or come back to this later?"*
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Validate + commit**

```bash
python -c "import yaml; f=open('google-services/skills/google-docs/SKILL.md'); content=f.read(); fm=content.split('---')[1]; print(yaml.safe_load(fm))"
git add google-services/skills/google-docs/SKILL.md
git commit -m "feat(google-services): add google-docs skill

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

### Task 3.4: Write skills/google-sheets/SKILL.md

**Spec reference:** Per-integration detail — Google Sheets.

**Files:**
- Create: `wecoded-marketplace/google-services/skills/google-sheets/SKILL.md`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the skill**

```markdown
---
name: google-sheets
description: "Use when the user wants to read cell values, write values, append rows, or create a new spreadsheet. Triggers on: what's in my spreadsheet, update cell, add a row, create a sheet, read column X. File-find operations ('where is my X sheet') belong to google-drive."
---

# Google Sheets

Content-level operations on Google Sheets. Finding the file belongs to google-drive.

```bash
source "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/lib/gws-wrapper.sh"
```

## Core commands

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Get sheet metadata | `gws_run sheets get <sheet-id>` |
| Create | `gws_run sheets create --title "<t>"` |
| Read values | `gws_run sheets values get <sheet-id> --range "A1:D10"` |
| Update values | `gws_run sheets values update <sheet-id> --range "A1" --values '[["hello"]]'` |
| Append row | `gws_run sheets values append <sheet-id> --range "Sheet1" --values '[["v1","v2"]]'` |

## Values vs formulas

`values get` returns calculated values by default. To get formula text, pass `--value-render-option FORMULA`. When the user asks "what's the formula in A1," use FORMULA mode; otherwise default to calculated.

## A1 vs R1C1

Default A1. Use R1C1 only if the user explicitly asks in that notation.

## Finding a sheet

Call google-drive first if the user names it rather than gives an ID.

## Handling auth expiry

Every call uses `gws_run`, which exits **2** with stderr line `AUTH_EXPIRED:<service>` when the user's 7-day OAuth refresh has lapsed.

**When this skill sees exit 2:**
1. Stop the current operation immediately. Do NOT retry automatically.
2. Emit a single marker line Claude can read: `[reauth-required: <service>]`.

**What Claude does next (follow this verbatim):**
1. Tell the user briefly, in natural language: *"Your Google connection needs a quick refresh — I'll open a browser. Approve the permissions and I'll finish {what the user asked for}."*
2. Run `bash "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/setup/reauth.sh"`.
3. On reauth exit 0: retry the original `gws_run` call with the same arguments, then complete the user's request as if nothing happened.
4. On reauth exit 1: tell the user plainly, *"I couldn't refresh the Google connection. Want me to try again, or come back to this later?"*
```

### Task 3.5: Write skills/google-slides/SKILL.md

**Spec reference:** Per-integration detail — Google Slides (Research Item 3 resolved GREEN — full read + write).

**Files:**
- Create: `wecoded-marketplace/google-services/skills/google-slides/SKILL.md`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the skill**

```markdown
---
name: google-slides
description: "Use when the user wants to read, create, edit, or export a Google Slides deck. Triggers on: what's in my presentation, create a deck, add a slide, replace text on slide 3, export deck as PDF. File-find operations belong to google-drive."
---

# Google Slides

Content-level operations on Google Slides decks. File-find belongs to google-drive; PDF export and listing decks hop to `gws drive` (per Google's own API design — Slides doesn't own those).

```bash
source "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/lib/gws-wrapper.sh"
```

## Core commands

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Read deck | `gws_run slides presentations get <deck-id>` |
| Create deck | `gws_run slides presentations create --title "<t>"` |
| Mutate deck | `gws_run slides presentations batchUpdate <deck-id> --requests '<json>'` |
| Export PDF | `gws_run drive files export <deck-id> --mime-type application/pdf --out <path>` |
| List decks | `gws_run drive files list --q "mimeType='application/vnd.google-apps.presentation'" --max 20` |

## batchUpdate — the write path

All edits (add/remove slides, insert/replace text, change layouts, images, tables) go through `batchUpdate` as a JSON array of request objects. Prefer batching multiple edits in one call over chaining many single-edit calls. Three common recipes:

**Add a title slide:**
```json
[{"createSlide": {"insertionIndex": 0, "slideLayoutReference": {"predefinedLayout": "TITLE"}}}]
```

**Insert text into an existing text box:**
```json
[{"insertText": {"objectId": "<element-id>", "text": "Hello", "insertionIndex": 0}}]
```

**Replace all instances of a string across the deck:**
```json
[{"replaceAllText": {"containsText": {"text": "{{date}}"}, "replaceText": "2026-04-16"}}]
```

## Slide structure

`presentations get` returns JSON with `slides[]`, each containing `pageElements` (text boxes, images, shapes). When summarizing for the user, extract text content from each text box. When making edits, use the element's `objectId` from this response.

## Handling auth expiry

Every call uses `gws_run`, which exits **2** with stderr line `AUTH_EXPIRED:<service>` when the user's 7-day OAuth refresh has lapsed.

**When this skill sees exit 2:**
1. Stop the current operation immediately. Do NOT retry automatically.
2. Emit a single marker line Claude can read: `[reauth-required: <service>]`.

**What Claude does next (follow this verbatim):**
1. Tell the user briefly, in natural language: *"Your Google connection needs a quick refresh — I'll open a browser. Approve the permissions and I'll finish {what the user asked for}."*
2. Run `bash "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/setup/reauth.sh"`.
3. On reauth exit 0: retry the original `gws_run` call with the same arguments, then complete the user's request as if nothing happened.
4. On reauth exit 1: tell the user plainly, *"I couldn't refresh the Google connection. Want me to try again, or come back to this later?"*
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Validate + commit**

```bash
python -c "import yaml; f=open('google-services/skills/google-slides/SKILL.md'); content=f.read(); fm=content.split('---')[1]; print(yaml.safe_load(fm))"
git add google-services/skills/google-slides/SKILL.md
git commit -m "feat(google-services): add google-slides skill

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

### Task 3.6: Write skills/google-calendar/SKILL.md

**Spec reference:** Per-integration detail — Google Calendar.

**Files:**
- Create: `wecoded-marketplace/google-services/skills/google-calendar/SKILL.md`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the skill**

```markdown
---
name: google-calendar
description: "Use when the user wants to check, create, update, or delete events in their Google Calendar. Triggers on: what's on my calendar, schedule a meeting, cancel my 3pm, when am I free, add a reminder. Handles multiple calendars (personal, family, work) with primary as default."
---

# Google Calendar

```bash
source "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/lib/gws-wrapper.sh"
```

## Core commands

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| List calendars | `gws_run calendar list` |
| List events | `gws_run calendar events list --max 10` |
| Create event | `gws_run calendar events create --summary "<s>" --start "<iso>" --end "<iso>"` |
| Update event | `gws_run calendar events update <event-id> --summary "<new>"` |
| Delete event | `gws_run calendar events delete <event-id>` |

## Multiple calendars

Default is primary. If the user names a specific calendar ("on my Family calendar"), pass `--calendar <calendar-id>` — find the ID from `gws_run calendar list`.

## Recurring events

When the user asks to update or delete "just this one" of a recurring event, pass the instance's event ID (has a suffix like `_20261023T090000Z`). When they mean the whole series, use the base event ID. If ambiguous, ask.

## Time zones

Events return in each calendar's default TZ. When formatting for the user, convert to the user's primary calendar's TZ (fetch from `gws_run calendar list`). Always display TZ abbreviation when it differs from the user's.

## Availability

For "when am I free today" / "free/busy" questions, use `gws_run calendar freebusy --start <iso> --end <iso> --calendars primary`.

## Handling auth expiry

Every call uses `gws_run`, which exits **2** with stderr line `AUTH_EXPIRED:<service>` when the user's 7-day OAuth refresh has lapsed.

**When this skill sees exit 2:**
1. Stop the current operation immediately. Do NOT retry automatically.
2. Emit a single marker line Claude can read: `[reauth-required: <service>]`.

**What Claude does next (follow this verbatim):**
1. Tell the user briefly, in natural language: *"Your Google connection needs a quick refresh — I'll open a browser. Approve the permissions and I'll finish {what the user asked for}."*
2. Run `bash "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/setup/reauth.sh"`.
3. On reauth exit 0: retry the original `gws_run` call with the same arguments, then complete the user's request as if nothing happened.
4. On reauth exit 1: tell the user plainly, *"I couldn't refresh the Google connection. Want me to try again, or come back to this later?"*
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Validate + commit**

```bash
python -c "import yaml; f=open('google-services/skills/google-calendar/SKILL.md'); content=f.read(); fm=content.split('---')[1]; print(yaml.safe_load(fm))"
git add google-services/skills/google-calendar/SKILL.md
git commit -m "feat(google-services): add google-calendar skill

```

## Phase 4 — Dev-time verification

From the spec's "Dev-time verification checklist (not shipped)." This phase gates shipping — no merge until every box is checked.

### Task 4.1: Write DEV-VERIFICATION.md

**Files:**
- Create: `wecoded-marketplace/google-services/docs/DEV-VERIFICATION.md`

- [ ] **Step 1: Copy the checklist from the spec**

```markdown
# Dev-time Verification

This checklist runs on a clean test machine before `google-services` is allowed to ship. NOT shipped to users — lives here only for our pre-ship gate.

- [ ] `/google-services-setup` completes end-to-end on macOS, Windows, Linux with no pre-existing `gcloud` or `gws` installed.
- [ ] Idempotent re-run with existing valid auth reports "already set up" and skips to probes.
- [ ] Partial-state re-run (re-run after bootstrap-gcp.sh but before consent-walkthrough.sh completes) detects existing project, skips project creation, resumes at the consent walkthrough.
- [ ] Gmail round-trip: send draft to self → fetch → delete. Leaves no residue.
- [ ] Drive round-trip: upload → list → download → trash.
- [ ] Docs round-trip: create → read → trash.
- [ ] Sheets round-trip: create → write A1 → read A1 → trash.
- [ ] Slides round-trip: create deck → batchUpdate to add a slide with text → get → `drive files export` to PDF → trash.
- [ ] Calendar round-trip: create event → list → delete.
- [ ] Migration: test machine with pre-installed `youcoded-drive` + `claudes-inbox` on hosted Gmail — setup cleans all artifacts.
- [ ] Skill discovery: compound prompts ("send an email with last week's budget sheet attached") route cleanly to one primary skill.
- [ ] Auto-reauth end-to-end: revoke the OAuth token manually (or wait for natural 7-day expiry), ask Claude a Google-related question, verify Claude detects AUTH_EXPIRED signal from the wrapper, runs reauth.sh, completes the user's request after the one-click browser consent — without any manual slash command from the user.
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Commit**

```bash
git add google-services/docs/DEV-VERIFICATION.md
git commit -m "docs(google-services): add dev-time verification checklist

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

### Task 4.2: Run the round-trip checks manually

**Files:** none modified; updates `DEV-VERIFICATION.md` as boxes tick.

For each round-trip below, run the exact commands, verify expected state, then check the box. Do NOT skip cleanup — a failed cleanup on any round-trip means the skill is shipping with a bug.

- [ ] **Step 1: Gmail round-trip**

```bash
# Send a draft to yourself
msgid=$(gws gmail draft --to destinmoss.work@gmail.com --subject "YouCoded Smoke Test" --body "hello" --json | jq -r .id)
# Verify it exists
gws gmail read "$msgid" | grep -q "hello" && echo OK
# Delete
gws gmail delete "$msgid"
# Confirm gone
gws gmail read "$msgid" 2>&1 | grep -q "not found" && echo CLEANED
```

Expected: `OK` then `CLEANED`. Check the box in DEV-VERIFICATION.md.

- [ ] **Step 2: Drive round-trip**

```bash
echo "smoke" > /tmp/yc-smoke.txt
fileid=$(gws drive upload /tmp/yc-smoke.txt --json | jq -r .id)
gws drive download "$fileid" --out /tmp/yc-smoke-back.txt
diff /tmp/yc-smoke.txt /tmp/yc-smoke-back.txt && echo OK
gws drive trash "$fileid" && echo CLEANED
rm /tmp/yc-smoke.txt /tmp/yc-smoke-back.txt
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Docs round-trip**

```bash
docid=$(gws docs create --title "YouCoded Smoke" --body "hello" --json | jq -r .documentId)
gws docs get "$docid" | grep -q "hello" && echo OK
gws drive trash "$docid" && echo CLEANED
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Sheets round-trip**

```bash
sid=$(gws sheets create --title "YouCoded Smoke" --json | jq -r .spreadsheetId)
gws sheets values update "$sid" --range "A1" --values '[["hello"]]'
gws sheets values get "$sid" --range "A1" | grep -q "hello" && echo OK
gws drive trash "$sid" && echo CLEANED
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Slides round-trip (via batchUpdate)**

```bash
# Create deck
deckid=$(gws slides presentations create --title "YouCoded Smoke" --json | jq -r .presentationId)

# Add a slide + insert text via batchUpdate
gws slides presentations batchUpdate "$deckid" --requests '[
  {"createSlide": {"insertionIndex": 1, "slideLayoutReference": {"predefinedLayout": "TITLE_AND_BODY"}}}
]'

# Verify the deck now has >=2 slides
count=$(gws slides presentations get "$deckid" --json | jq '.slides | length')
[ "$count" -ge 2 ] && echo OK

# Export to PDF through drive
gws drive files export "$deckid" --mime-type application/pdf --out /tmp/yc-slides-smoke.pdf
[ -s /tmp/yc-slides-smoke.pdf ] && echo EXPORTED

# Cleanup
gws drive files trash "$deckid" && echo CLEANED
rm /tmp/yc-slides-smoke.pdf
```

- [ ] **Step 6: Calendar round-trip**

```bash
start=$(date -u -v+1H +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ" 2>/dev/null || date -u -d "+1 hour" +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")
end=$(date -u -v+2H +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ" 2>/dev/null || date -u -d "+2 hour" +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")
eid=$(gws calendar events create --summary "YC Smoke" --start "$start" --end "$end" --json | jq -r .id)
gws calendar events list --max 5 | grep -q "YC Smoke" && echo OK
gws calendar events delete "$eid" && echo CLEANED
```

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit the checklist updates**

```bash
cd C:/Users/desti/youcoded-dev/.worktrees/google-services-marketplace
git add google-services/docs/DEV-VERIFICATION.md
git commit -m "verify(google-services): round-trip checks pass for all 6 services

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

### Task 4.3: Skill-matcher compound-prompt test

**Files:** none modified permanently; `DEV-VERIFICATION.md` checkbox ticks.

- [ ] **Step 1: Start a fresh Claude Code session with google-services installed**

Install the plugin locally from the worktree path, then start a new session.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the compound-prompt test**

Send each prompt and record which skill(s) activate. A "clean" match means exactly one primary skill.

| Prompt | Primary skill expected | Secondary (tool-use) OK |
|--------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| "send an email to Mom" | gmail | — |
| "find my budget spreadsheet" | google-drive | — |
| "what does my budget spreadsheet say about March?" | google-sheets | google-drive (finds the file) |
| "send an email with last week's budget sheet attached" | gmail | google-drive / google-sheets |
| "add a meeting with Alice tomorrow at 3" | google-calendar | — |
| "create a doc with the notes from my last email" | google-docs | gmail |

Document any mismatch (wrong primary, no match, two primaries) in DEV-VERIFICATION.md. If mismatches found, tune the SKILL.md `description` fields and re-run.

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit any SKILL.md tuning + check the box**

```bash
git add google-services/skills/*/SKILL.md google-services/docs/DEV-VERIFICATION.md
git commit -m "tune(google-services): skill descriptions calibrated for compound prompts

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

### Task 4.4: Idempotency + partial-state resume test

**Files:** `DEV-VERIFICATION.md` checkboxes tick.

- [ ] **Step 1: Re-run the setup on a machine already set up**

```bash
/google-services-setup
```

Expected output begins "Found existing YouCoded connection..." and ends with the full set of ✓ probes. No second project created.

- [ ] **Step 2: Simulate partial-state**

Create a throwaway user account, run setup to completion of Step 3A (bootstrap-gcp.sh done, APIs enabled) then kill it (Ctrl-C) before consent-walkthrough.sh finishes.

Re-run `/google-services-setup`. Expected: detects existing project (bootstrap skips recreation), resumes at the consent walkthrough. Does NOT create a second project.

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit**

```bash
git add google-services/docs/DEV-VERIFICATION.md
git commit -m "verify(google-services): idempotency and partial-state resume confirmed

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

### Task 4.5: Auto-reauth end-to-end test

**Spec reference:** Auto-reauth flow.

**Files:** `DEV-VERIFICATION.md` checkbox ticks.

This is the most important test for v1 — the user experience of the 7-day reauth cycle lives or dies here.

- [ ] **Step 1: Force an auth-expired state**

Option A (fastest): go to https://myaccount.google.com/permissions and revoke access for "YouCoded Personal." This invalidates the refresh token immediately.

Option B (natural): wait 7 days after setup.

- [ ] **Step 2: In a fresh Claude session with google-services installed, ask a Google-related question**

Example prompts:
- *"send a test email to myself with the subject 'reauth test'"*
- *"what's on my calendar tomorrow"*
- *"what are the last 3 files in my Drive"*

- [ ] **Step 3: Observe Claude's behavior**

Expected flow:
1. Claude picks the correct skill (e.g., gmail for the email prompt).
2. Skill calls `gws_run`. Wrapper returns exit 2 + `AUTH_EXPIRED:<service>` on stderr.
3. Skill prints `[reauth-required: <service>]`.
4. Claude says something like: *"Your Google connection needs a quick refresh — I'll open a browser. Approve the permissions and I'll finish sending that email."*
5. Claude runs `bash "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/setup/reauth.sh"`.
6. Default browser opens to Google's consent page. User clicks Allow.
7. `reauth.sh` exits 0.
8. Claude retries the original `gws_run` call. Succeeds.
9. User's original request completes. Claude reports done.

**Failure modes to probe separately:**
- Close the browser mid-reauth → reauth.sh exits 1; Claude tells user plainly and offers retry.
- Cancel the OAuth consent → same as above.

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add google-services/docs/DEV-VERIFICATION.md
git commit -m "verify(google-services): auto-reauth end-to-end flow confirmed

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

---

## Phase 5 — Migration (clean cutover)

All in the same PR that ships google-services. Split across two worktrees (marketplace + core) because different repos.

### Task 5.1: Rewrite claudes-inbox/providers/gmail.md

**Worktree:** `wecoded-marketplace` (google-services-marketplace worktree).

**Spec reference:** Migration.

**Files:**
- Modify: `wecoded-marketplace/youcoded-inbox/skills/claudes-inbox/providers/gmail.md`

- [ ] **Step 1: Read the current file**

```bash
cd C:/Users/desti/youcoded-dev/.worktrees/google-services-marketplace
cat youcoded-inbox/skills/claudes-inbox/providers/gmail.md
```

Record: (a) what provider interface the inbox skill expects, (b) which `mcp__claude_ai_Gmail__*` calls need replacement.

- [ ] **Step 2: Rewrite body using gws**

Replace every `mcp__claude_ai_Gmail__list_messages` / `mcp__claude_ai_Gmail__get_message` call with the equivalent `gws gmail list` / `gws gmail read`. Preserve the provider's outer contract — the inbox skill should not need to change.

- [ ] **Step 3: Run the inbox skill end-to-end manually**

If claudes-inbox has its own setup flow, run it and confirm messages are still ingested.

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add youcoded-inbox/skills/claudes-inbox/providers/gmail.md
git commit -m "refactor(youcoded-inbox): migrate Gmail provider from hosted MCP to gws

Aligns with google-services bundle which replaces the hosted Gmail MCP path.
See docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-16-google-services-design.md migration section.

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

### Task 5.2: Delete youcoded-drive directory

**Worktree:** `wecoded-marketplace`.

**Files:**
- Delete: `wecoded-marketplace/youcoded-drive/` (entire directory)
- Modify: `wecoded-marketplace/index.json` (remove youcoded-drive entry)

- [ ] **Step 1: Confirm youcoded-drive is entirely superseded**

```bash
grep -r "youcoded-drive" wecoded-marketplace/ --exclude-dir=youcoded-drive
```

Should return only: `index.json` entry and any references in the Google Services docs. Anything else found needs evaluation — do not delete yet, surface to Destin.

- [ ] **Step 2: Delete the directory**

```bash
git rm -r youcoded-drive/
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Remove the index entry**

Open `index.json`, delete the object with `"id": "youcoded-drive"`. Validate JSON parses.

```bash
python -c "import json; json.load(open('index.json'))" && echo OK
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add -u
git commit -m "chore(marketplace): retire youcoded-drive (superseded by google-services)

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

### Task 5.3: Delete deprecated google-workspace entry

**Worktree:** `wecoded-marketplace`.

**Files:**
- Modify: `wecoded-marketplace/index.json`

- [ ] **Step 1: Remove the entry**

Open `index.json`, delete the object with `"id": "google-workspace"` (the one with `"deprecated": true`). Validate JSON.

```bash
python -c "import json; json.load(open('index.json'))" && echo OK
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Commit**

```bash
git add index.json
git commit -m "chore(marketplace): delete deprecated google-workspace metadata entry

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

### Task 5.4: Delete youcoded-messaging/imessages subdirectory

**Worktree:** `wecoded-marketplace`.

**Files:**
- Delete: `wecoded-marketplace/youcoded-messaging/imessages/` (entire subdir)

- [ ] **Step 1: Confirm the Anthropic iMessage plugin is the intended replacement**

```bash
grep -A 5 '"imessage"' wecoded-marketplace/index.json
```

Should show the Anthropic-sourced imessage entry present.

- [ ] **Step 2: Delete**

```bash
cd C:/Users/desti/youcoded-dev/.worktrees/google-services-marketplace
git rm -r youcoded-messaging/imessages/
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Update youcoded-messaging's plugin.json if it references iMessage in its description**

```bash
cat youcoded-messaging/plugin.json
```

Edit to remove iMessage references; scope the description to Google Messages only. (The Google Messages bundle's own spec will further restructure this plugin.)

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add -u youcoded-messaging/
git commit -m "chore(youcoded-messaging): remove iMessage (Anthropic plugin supersedes)

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

### Task 5.5: Remove Gmail/Calendar blocks from tool-router.sh

**Worktree:** `youcoded-core` (google-services-core worktree).

**Files:**
- Modify: `youcoded-core/hooks/tool-router.sh`

- [ ] **Step 1: Read the current hook**

```bash
cd C:/Users/desti/youcoded-dev/.worktrees/google-services-core
cat hooks/tool-router.sh
```

Locate the `mcp__claude_ai_Gmail__*` and `mcp__claude_ai_Google_Calendar__*` block + redirect clauses.

- [ ] **Step 2: Remove the blocks, keep the rest of the router**

Delete only the Gmail and Calendar clauses. Other tool routes (if any) stay.

- [ ] **Step 3: Verify the hook still runs without error**

```bash
bash hooks/tool-router.sh < /dev/null
echo "exit: $?"
```

Expected: exits cleanly.

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add hooks/tool-router.sh
git commit -m "chore(hooks): remove Gmail and Calendar redirects from tool-router

google-services bundle provides real Gmail/Calendar integrations, so the
redirect-to-not-yet-built-gws block in this hook is no longer needed.
See docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-16-google-services-design.md.

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

### Task 5.6: Write migrate-legacy.sh

**Worktree:** `wecoded-marketplace`.

**Spec reference:** User-facing flow Step 7.

**Files:**
- Create: `wecoded-marketplace/google-services/setup/migrate-legacy.sh`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the migration script**

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# migrate-legacy.sh
# Run at end of /google-services-setup. Detects artifacts from the predecessor
# integrations on the user's machine and cleans them up silently.

set -u

any_cleaned=0

# rclone gdrive: remote (from youcoded-drive)
if command -v rclone >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  if rclone listremotes 2>/dev/null | grep -q "^gdrive:$"; then
    rclone config delete gdrive >/dev/null 2>&1 || true
    any_cleaned=1
  fi
fi

# Disable deprecated google-workspace plugin if enabled
SETTINGS="$HOME/.claude/settings.json"
if [ -f "$SETTINGS" ] && grep -q "\"google-workspace@" "$SETTINGS"; then
  # Remove the entry via python (preserves JSON formatting)
  python - <<'PY' "$SETTINGS"
import json, sys
p = sys.argv[1]
with open(p) as f: s = json.load(f)
ep = s.get("enabledPlugins", {})
for k in list(ep.keys()):
    if k.startswith("google-workspace@"):
        del ep[k]
with open(p, "w") as f: json.dump(s, f, indent=2)
PY
  any_cleaned=1
fi

# Emit a single line only if something was cleaned
if [ "$any_cleaned" = "1" ]; then
  echo "  ✓ Cleaning up old Google connections"
fi

exit 0
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Make executable, lint**

```bash
cd C:/Users/desti/youcoded-dev/.worktrees/google-services-marketplace
chmod +x google-services/setup/migrate-legacy.sh
git update-index --chmod=+x google-services/setup/migrate-legacy.sh
shellcheck google-services/setup/migrate-legacy.sh
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Test on a machine with rclone gdrive configured**

If a test machine with the legacy state is available, run and verify cleanup.

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add google-services/setup/migrate-legacy.sh
git commit -m "feat(google-services): add migrate-legacy.sh for user-machine cleanup

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

### Task 5.7: Migration end-to-end test

**Worktree:** both.

**Files:** `DEV-VERIFICATION.md` checkbox ticks.

- [ ] **Step 1: Provision a test machine with all legacy state present**

Install youcoded-drive + claudes-inbox + enable google-workspace in settings + configure rclone gdrive.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run /google-services-setup end-to-end**

Observe: Step 7 removes rclone gdrive, disables google-workspace in settings, leaves youcoded-inbox intact (only its provider body changed, which was in the marketplace PR, not the user machine).

- [ ] **Step 3: Verify clean state**

```bash
rclone listremotes | grep -v "^gdrive:" || echo NO_GDRIVE
grep "google-workspace" ~/.claude/settings.json || echo NO_GW_ENTRY
```

Both should print their "NO" lines.

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit DEV-VERIFICATION.md tick**

```bash
cd C:/Users/desti/youcoded-dev/.worktrees/google-services-marketplace
git add google-services/docs/DEV-VERIFICATION.md
git commit -m "verify(google-services): migration cutover confirmed on test machine

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

---

## Phase 6 — Ship

### Task 6.1: Merge both worktrees to master, push

- [ ] **Step 1: Merge marketplace worktree**

```bash
cd C:/Users/desti/youcoded-dev/wecoded-marketplace
git fetch origin && git pull origin master  # ensure up to date
git merge --no-ff feat/google-services -m "feat: google-services bundle (Phase 1–5 complete)"
git push origin master
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Merge core worktree**

```bash
cd C:/Users/desti/youcoded-dev/youcoded-core
git fetch origin && git pull origin master
git merge --no-ff feat/google-services-hook-cleanup -m "chore(hooks): remove tool-router Gmail/Calendar blocks (paired with google-services)"
git push origin master
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Verify both master branches contain the merges**

cd C:/Users/desti/youcoded-dev/youcoded-core && git log --oneline master -5
```

### Task 6.2: Clean up worktrees + branches

- [ ] **Step 1: Remove marketplace worktree**

```bash
cd C:/Users/desti/youcoded-dev/wecoded-marketplace
# Verify the feature commits are on master first
git branch --contains $(git rev-parse feat/google-services) | grep -q master || { echo "NOT MERGED"; exit 1; }
git worktree remove ../.worktrees/google-services-marketplace
git branch -D feat/google-services
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Remove core worktree**

```bash
cd C:/Users/desti/youcoded-dev/youcoded-core
git branch --contains $(git rev-parse feat/google-services-hook-cleanup) | grep -q master || { echo "NOT MERGED"; exit 1; }
git worktree remove ../.worktrees/google-services-core
git branch -D feat/google-services-hook-cleanup
```

### Task 6.3: Retire the monolithic marketplace-integrations-v2.md plan

**Spec reference:** none (workspace hygiene).

**Files:**
- Modify: `docs/plans/marketplace-integrations-v2.md` — delete file, or replace with a one-line pointer to the new per-bundle specs

- [ ] **Step 1: Verify Google Services ships and the old plan's Google content is superseded**

Confirm the merge from Task 6.1 is on master and the spec at `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-16-google-services-design.md` exists.

- [ ] **Step 2: Replace old plan with a pointer**

Overwrite `docs/plans/marketplace-integrations-v2.md` with:

```markdown
# Marketplace Integrations — Superseded

This monolithic plan has been decomposed into per-bundle specs under
`docs/superpowers/specs/`. See:

- Google Services — [2026-04-16-google-services-design.md](../superpowers/specs/2026-04-16-google-services-design.md) (shipped)
- Apple Services — pending
- iMessage — pending
- Google Messages — pending
- macOS Control — pending
- Windows Control — pending
- Todoist — pending
- GitHub — pending
- Chrome — pending

The original document is preserved in git history pre-dating this commit.
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit**

```bash
cd C:/Users/desti/youcoded-dev
git add docs/plans/marketplace-integrations-v2.md
git commit -m "docs: retire monolithic marketplace-integrations plan

Decomposed into per-bundle specs under docs/superpowers/specs/. First bundle
(google-services) has shipped.

## Self-review (revised post-research)

### Spec coverage

| Spec section | Task(s) that implement it |
|--------------|---------------------------|
| Goal | Phase 1–5 as a whole |
| Scope — In scope | Tasks 3.1–3.6 (six skills) |
| Scope — Out of scope | Documented in plugin.json + spec; no task needed |
| Foundation — gws | Task 2.2 (install-gws.sh) |
| Foundation — gcloud | Task 2.1 (install-gcloud.sh) |
| OAuth strategy (BYO-GCP with auto-reauth) | Tasks 2.3 (bootstrap-gcp.sh) + 2.3.5 (consent-walkthrough.sh) + 2.5 (wrapper) + 2.5.5 (reauth.sh) |
| User-facing language policy | Enforced in Task 2.6 (slash command); spot-checked in every Phase 2/3 task |
| Architecture — Plugin layout | Task 1.2 |
| Architecture — How skills invoke gws | Tasks 2.5 (wrapper) + 3.1–3.6 (skills) |
| Architecture — How setup works | Task 2.6 |
| Architecture — Skill discovery | Tasks 3.1–3.6 + Task 4.3 (matcher test) |
| User-facing flow Step 0–7 | Task 2.6 (slash command authoritative); Step 3 hybrid split across Tasks 2.3 + 2.3.5 |
| Auto-reauth flow | Tasks 2.5 (AUTH_EXPIRED contract) + 2.5.5 (reauth.sh) + 3.1–3.6 (each skill's "Handling auth expiry" section) + 4.5 (end-to-end test) |
| Per-integration — Gmail | Task 3.1 |
| Per-integration — Drive | Task 3.2 |
| Per-integration — Docs | Task 3.3 |
| Per-integration — Sheets | Task 3.4 |
| Per-integration — Slides (GREEN: full read+write via batchUpdate) | Task 3.5 |
| Per-integration — Calendar | Task 3.6 |
| Per-integration — Shared concerns | Task 2.5 |
| Migration — registry changes | Tasks 5.1–5.4 |
| Migration — user-machine reconciliation | Task 5.6 |
| Migration — pre-ship verification | Task 5.7 |
| Failure modes | Handled in scripts (Tasks 2.1–2.4 + 2.3.5 + 2.5.5); no dedicated spec section task |
| Research outcomes (resolved 2026-04-16) | Phase 0 summary; docs/superpowers/plans/research/ findings committed |
| Dev-time verification checklist | Tasks 4.1–4.5 |
| Out of scope (v1) including v2 verified-app note | Not implemented by design |

No gaps.

### Placeholder scan

All code blocks contain real code. One deliberate note in the plan: `gws auth setup --client-id` flag surface in reauth.sh (Task 2.5.5 Step 4) requires verification against pinned gws version at implementation time — explicit "verify this" step in the task, not a placeholder.

### Type consistency

- `gws_run <service> <args>` — consistent across all six skills and the wrapper (Task 2.5). Service is always the first positional arg.
- `AUTH_EXPIRED:<service>` — stable stderr marker emitted by wrapper (Task 2.5), matched by every skill's auth-expiry section (Tasks 3.1–3.6), produces `[reauth-required: <service>]` for Claude.
- `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` — used identically in all skill SKILL.md files.
- `YOUCODED_OUTPUT_DIR` — set in the slash command (Task 2.6), consumed in bootstrap-gcp.sh (Task 2.3) and consent-walkthrough.sh (Task 2.3.5). Name matches.
- `PROJECT_ID` — emitted by bootstrap-gcp.sh to `$YOUCODED_OUTPUT_DIR/project.env` (Task 2.3), sourced by consent-walkthrough.sh (Task 2.3.5). Name matches.
- `oauth-credentials.json` — written by consent-walkthrough.sh (Task 2.3.5), read by reauth.sh (Task 2.5.5) and the slash command Step 5 (Task 2.6). Schema: `{client_id, client_secret, project_id}`.
- `PROJECT_ID` — set by bootstrap-gcp.sh, consumed for the warning screen in Task 2.6. Matches.

No drift.
