Progress
Done: Windows regression fixes merged to remote app master via https://github.com/itsdestin/youcoded/pull/632 (1e8797ec3). Buddy click/drag, normal sends and Send anyway VM-verified; watcher ordering/concurrency regressions pinned. Final local full verification: 20,434 passed; Windows/macOS and required Linux/Android CI passed.
Next: This session is closed. The three original buddy items below remain open and unchanged; do not mark them completed by PR #632. A new installer release is a separate action.
Blocked: No blocker for the merged fixes. SmartScreen reputation is external; remaining authenticated OneDrive validation is recorded against #93.

From the old roadmap (other-features › buddy, status confirmed, seen on desktop, last checked 2026-09-01)
Buddy window: 3 open items. (a) Typing in the buddy window while Claude Code shows a permission, question or plan menu sends it straight into the menu and confirms the highlighted option; the main chat refuses and offers "Send anyway" (report: docs/active/investigations/2026-09-01-buddy-chat-input-bar-pty-gate.md). (b) The buddy's Allow button for multiple-choice questions may do nothing, as it did for plans; questions are unchecked. (c) The buddy never does anything of his own between reactions: wanted are small spontaneous moments (a glance, a stretch, dozing off after a few quiet minutes, waking when anything happens), always quieter than the "a session needs you" animation and stopping the instant a session turns red, amber or blue. The asleep pose is built and signed off; nothing drives it yet.
