title: Support Steam Deck and Plasma Mobile in Swipe Keyboard
stage: build
tags: operations, feature
related: 82, 165
branch: 168-support-steam-deck-and-plasma
created: 2026-10-19
why: Reddit feedback identifies Steam Deck and Plasma Mobile as priority targets. Destin requests planning only before context compaction: think through Steam Deck Desktop and Gaming Mode plus Plasma Mobile, with local build/test/iterate gates on this device until each implementation is working in its tested environment. No implementation, image downloads, VM launches, publication, or changes to the installed keyboard in this planning session. Scope includes stock SteamOS compatibility, update-safe packaging, Mobile configuration ownership, ARM64/glibc and separately musl, safety/lifecycle acceptance, honest physical-device evidence boundaries and compact-ready handoff.

Progress
Done: v0.4.1-1 published 2026-10-23 (PRs #9, #10; main 6e71e22): automatic signed updates on Deck/Fedora/Arch (live site itsdestin.github.io/swipe-keyboard verified; bundle install updated from it), Gaming Mode on stable Steam (origin-checked keyboard page), SteamOS 3.9.5 tested in VM. Two independent security reviews.
Next: M11 real-Deck pass; known limits in swipe-keyboard docs/active/plans/2026-10-23-auto-updates.md (index replay/freeze, key rotation, beta-Steam not re-run in VM).
