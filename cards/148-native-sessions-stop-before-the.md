Progress
Done: Built isolated production-runtime harness lab, SDK-attempt accounting, paired reports, Harbor adapter and three pilot tasks. Added report-delivery lifecycle regression; original incident not reproduced. 28 Node lab tests, 3 Harbor adapter tests and desktop verify pass.
Next: Run container end-to-end smoke, then an approved capped matched-model pilot; expand held-out tasks before public claims. Continue original false-waiting investigation from actual traces.
Blocked: Current account cannot access Docker socket. Paid provider runs require separately approved cap/key. Source work remains local and uncommitted.

From the old roadmap (moved 2026-10-16)
Native sessions stop working before the job is done, and say it is still going. Destin,
2026-10-16, "Improving ASTRA Architectural 3D Models" (GPT 6 Astra, Full Auto, v1.3.1-beta.89):
the assistant told him a fix was "still underway" and "being fixed"; when he asked "are you
sure its being fixed? i dont see any agents running", nothing was running. Before that it
posted repeated "still running; no new result yet" messages that it later called "noise from
background jobs finishing". The turn had ended while the work was still owed. Investigate:
(a) does the turn end while helper agents or background jobs are still pending, and does a
finishing job's notice wrongly count as a new turn; (b) does the assistant claim work is
running that it never started, or one that was cancelled or failed without a visible error;
(c) does it happen on other models or only GPT 6 Astra. Start from this session's saved
chat and turn log, not from the live app. Wanted: a turn either keeps working until done or
says plainly that it stopped and why
