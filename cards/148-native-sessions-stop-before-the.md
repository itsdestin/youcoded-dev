Progress
Done: Harbor 0.24.0 synthetic Docker run passed actual adapter setup, production host, usage capture and independent verifier (reward 1, no exception, no model calls). Added credential-free adapter smoke mode and synthetic-result comparison guards. Temporary Docker socket ACL was removed after validation.
Next: Receive dedicated non-resetting OpenRouter key capped at 0, verify cap via provider API, then run approved matched-model pilot within the total cap.
Blocked: Awaiting dedicated capped API key; no paid calls made. Source remains local and uncommitted.

From the old roadmap (moved 2026-10-16)
Native sessions stop working before the job is done, and say it is still going. Destin,
2026-10-16, "Improving ASTRA Architectural 3D Models" (GPT 6 Astra, Full Auto, v1.3.1-beta.89):
the assistant told him a fix was "still underway" and "being fixed"; when he asked "are you
sure its being fixed? i dont see any agents running", nothing was running. Before that it
posted repeated "still running; no new result yet" messages that it later called "noise from
background jobs finishing". The turn had ended while the work was still owed. Investigate:
(a) does the turn end while helper agents or background jobs are still pending, and does a
finishing job's notice wrongly count as a new turn; (b) does the assistant claim work is
running that it never started, or one that was cancelled or failed without a visible error;
(c) does it happen on other models or only GPT 6 Astra. Start from this session's saved
chat and turn log, not from the live app. Wanted: a turn either keeps working until done or
says plainly that it stopped and why
