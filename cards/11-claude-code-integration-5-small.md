summary: A broken settings file is replaced without telling you, one warning looks different from the rest, and Android needs a newer Claude Code.

Progress
Done: nothing recorded.
Next: not decided.
Blocked: nothing recorded.

See also #15: 11(e) and 15(h) both say the recorded Claude Code screens the tests replay go stale, so a reworded prompt in a newer Claude Code breaks the app without failing a test.

From the old roadmap (claude-code-integration, status confirmed, seen on all, last checked 2026-09-16)
Claude Code integration: 5 small faults. (a) If `~/.claude/settings.json` cannot be read at launch, the app moves it aside as a `.corrupt-<time>` backup and writes a fresh one, telling nobody; wanted an in-app notice with an open button. (b) A launch-time hook change is silently skipped when another writer holds the file's lock over 3 s, seen only on an overloaded Windows CI runner; leave it, raise the wait to ~10 s, or say so in the app. (c) Fast mode's "Billed Per Token" warning is a one-off box, not the shared warning box. (d) On Android, protection stopping a `claude` started in a chat from taking over that chat does nothing until Android's bundled Claude Code (2.1.112) is updated. (e) The recorded Claude Code screens the tests replay are from 2.1.281; a reworded prompt in a newer version would pass tests and break the real thing — re-record them.
