From the old roadmap (user-interface, status confirmed, seen on all, last checked 2026-09-11)
Error messages still guess at causes in many places. The app-wide re-audit is done and batch 1 of 7 (seventeen messages that stated something false) shipped 2026-09-11. Left: Android and crash plumbing, one Report/Diagnose block, "couldn't load" shown as "none", silent action failures, look and wording, guards. Destin's rule: every error state offers an action

From the 2026-10-16 document sweep
- The report-a-bug flow has gaps: no catch for failures, logs are sent to the assistant before review, no attachments (E-01..E-08). Source: docs/archive/investigations/2026-09-08-error-states-development-audit.md
