title: Sign the Mac app so it opens without warnings

area: Leaving & updating
side: behind
platform: Mac only
paused: Deferred to 1.3.2 by Destin; not a 1.3.1 release blocker.

Progress
Done: Native Mac preflight PASSED in third trial39292665007/job118197126481: imported Developer ID, private-key access and disposable-code signing verified. Fixed upstream builder26.15.3 wrong-keychain-password defect with guarded atomic3-line correction; real-module and real-TmpDir regressions. Full local verify passed20620tests/79skipped plus allgates; fresh review passed; eight candidate commits secrets-scanned/pushed. Final source3054069ec matches reviewed d524a1e44.
Next: Third Mac-only trial is running full tests, then both architectures packaging/notarization/final-DMG and Office checks. Read actual completed log and inspect installers before claiming readiness.
Blocked: No app notarization/installer success observed yet. Temporary policy63607274 confirmed removed at admission; only normal signing refs should remain. No merge/public release authorized.

- 2026-10-18 session/release-1-3-2: Destin completed paid enrollment; payment processing up to 24h. Wants 1.3.1 to be the first Developer ID-signed/notarized Mac release. No Apple secrets or signing config changed yet.

From the old roadmap (dev-workspace › release, status blocked, seen on n/a, last checked 2026-09-04)
Mac installers: nothing is signed or notarized, and a Mac download may open as "broken". Since 2026-07-23 a dependency update stopped the Mac build being stamped, so macOS rejects it and the "Open Anyway" button vanished (terminal command only; in-app updates hit it too). Fix merged 2026-09-04 (build checks its own seal, fails if it cannot sign); still open: a Mac confirming "Open Anyway" is back on a build cut after it (test run 33921417200). Signing is blocked: Apple refused the LLC's account on 2026-10-01; retry from an Apple device or via Apple Support, then it is CI wiring. Windows is done (signed "Destin Moss").
